# E-shop-Project

This is an e-shop i build in terms of a uni project.
The main subject was to create an e-shop of any sport i like. I chose a Muay-Thai e-shop and added products such as boxing gloves,t-shirts,sorts.
I used WooCommerce an add-on on Wordpress and the language of the e-shop is Greek.
I created it localy and used Xampp in order to connect to a database.
