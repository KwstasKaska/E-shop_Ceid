# E-shop Project

This is an e-shop i build in terms of a uni project.

The main subject was to create an e-shop of any sport i like. I chose a Muay-Thai e-shop and added products such as boxing gloves,t-shirts,sorts.
I used WooCommerce an add-on on Wordpress and the language of the e-shop is Greek.

I created it localy and used Xampp in order to connect to a database(I have uploaded the database i exported).

I also made an facebook add in order to interact with adds in a well-known social media platform.The report is in Greek.
